Pokemon Auto Battler / Roguelite

general idea:
	select one of three randomly generated pokemon to begin your adventure. They will have X offensive moves and start at level 1.
 
	Encounter random teams of pokemon with your number of pokemon (+/- 1, 6 max) and BATTLE
		Coin flip to who attacks first, 
		then it is alternating turns. 
		Random targets are selected for each attack. 
		Whoever has last man standing wins.

	If you win, your pokemon will increase in level/experience and stats will be increased accordingly. Proceeding, there will be an intermediary event where either you get an item to add to your team, or another follower to join your team. These events can be denied or accepted and the event will follow accordingly. Items once put on a poke, or pokes once added to your team, can not be removed for the remainder of the game.
	Battle -> Item/follower -> Battle -> Item/follower … and so on until you lose a battle
